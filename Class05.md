## Images: 

#### Choosing Images for Your Site: 

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one, Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description. If you do not have photographs to use on your website, there are companies who sell stock images. 

* Images should: 

1. Be relevant. 
2. Convey information. 
3. Convey the right mood. 
4. Be instantly recognisable. 
5. Fit the color palette. 

* Storing Images on Your Site: If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses, As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. 

#### Adding Images: 

* "<img>": To add an image into the page you need to use an "<img>" element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
 
 1. src: This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images). 
 2. alt: This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
 
* Height & Width of Images: You will also often see an "<img>" element use two other attributes that specify its size:
 
 1. height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
 2. width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels. 

* Where to Place Images in Your Code: Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:

 1. before a paragraph: The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
 2. inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
 3. in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

* Three Rules for Creating Images: There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are summarized below: 

 1. Save images in the right format: Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load. 
 2. Save images at the right size: You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.
 3. Use the correct resolution: Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers to the number of dots per inch. 

* Image Formats: 

 1. JPEG: Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG. 
 2. GIF: When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as flat color. 

* Image Dimensions: 

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page, For example, if you have designed a page to include an image that is 300 pixels wide by 150 pixels tall, the image you use should be 300 x 150 pixels. You may need to use image editing tools to resize and crop the image. 

* Image Resolution: 

Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

* Vector Images: 

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

* Animated GIFs: 

Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

* Transparency: 

Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats:

 1. Transparent GIF: If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected).
 2. PNG: If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semiopaque transparency or a dropshadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG.

* Figure: "<figure>": Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new "<figure>" element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
