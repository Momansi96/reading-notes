## JavaScript Call Stack


* What is a ‘call’?

The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). 

* How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

Once. 

* What does LIFO mean?

 Last In, First Out (LIFO). 

* Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.



* What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. 


## error messages 


* What is a ‘refrence error’?

when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

* What is a ‘syntax error’?

* What is a ‘range error’?

When you try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length. 

* What is a ‘type error’?

this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible,

* What is a breakpoint?

The breakpoint can be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

* What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

A debugger is a program that allows you to step through another program one line at a time. This is very useful when trying to identify incorrect code and analyze how a program "flows". Key concepts include: Breakpoints, Stepping, and Viewing data.
