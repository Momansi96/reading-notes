## Structure:

#### How Pages Uses Structure: 

Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. 
Structure helps readers understand the stories in the
newspaper.
The structure is very similar then a news story is viewed
online (although it may also feature audio or video).

#### HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages: 

To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. 
Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

- HTML structure: 

1- <body>: 

Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.

2- <head>
Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element.
This contains information about the page (rather than
information that is shown within the main part of the browser window.
You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head>
element. 

3- <title>
The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
