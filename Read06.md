## Introduction to javascript: 

JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly you will need to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS. Beyond that, no prior experience with programming is necessary. 

- Learning to program with JavaScript involves: 

1- Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them. 

2- Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences. 

3- Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today. 

#### How does Javascript makes pages more interactive: 

1- ACCESS CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. 

2- MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 

3- PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.

4- REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. 


## The ABC of programming: 

#### What is a script and how do I create one? 

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

- WRITING A SCRIPT: 
 1- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

 2- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.


#### Designing a script: 

1- Tasks: 
Once you know the the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it. 

2- Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps, when you are ready to code the script, these steps can be translated into lines of code. 


## Expressions & Operators: 


#### Expressions: 

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions: 

1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE. 

2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE. 

#### Operators: 

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

- There are several types of operators such as: 

1- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Assign a value to a variable.

2-ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: Perform basic math.

 - ORDER OF EXECUTION:  Several arithmetic operations can be performed in one expression, but it is important to understand how the result will be calculated. Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction.

3-STRING OPERATORS: Combine two strings. 

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol, It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 


## FUNCTION: 


#### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

#### Declaring a function: 

To create a function, you give it a name and then wright the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces, this is called decraling a function. 

#### Calling a function: 

Having declared the function, you can execute all the statements inside it using only one line of code, this is called calling a function. 

#### Declaring a function that need information: 

sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task, in such cases you need to add the parameters when you declare the function, inside the function the parameters act like variables. 

#### Calling a function that need information:

When you call the function that has parameters, you specify the value it should use in the parantheses that follows it's name, the values are called arguments.
