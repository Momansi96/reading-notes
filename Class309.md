## Functional Programming


* What is functional programming?

functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

* What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties:
 1. The function return values are identical for identical arguments.
 2. The function application has no side effects.


* What are the benefits of a pure function?

they are immediately testable, They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments.
They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier. 

* What is immutability?

an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. 

* What is Referential transparency?

Referential transparency is a property of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior. 


## Node.js 


* What is a module?

It is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application.

* What does the word ‘require’ do?

require function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files.

* How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

using the require function

* What do we have to do to make a module available?

using a render function
