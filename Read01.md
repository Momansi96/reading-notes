## Mastering Markdown 

**Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.**

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Gists.
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests.
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension.

### Syntax guide

1- Headers: you can add this symbol (#) to confirm a header the more (#) you use means the the header is less important and the font is smaller. 

2- Emphasis: you can make the text bold by applying this symbol (**text**). 
  - you can make the text italic by applying this symbol (*text*). 

3- Lists: you can make lists by simply adding a number before the sentence such as (1-). 
  - you can make lists also by simply adding a dash before the sentence such as (-). 

4- images: you can add an image by (![title of image](image link)).  

5- links: you can add an link by ([title of link](link)).
