## Choosing A Text Editor. 

#### What is a text editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as a web developer. 

What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some of the most important features are: 

1- code completion: 

Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed, This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos, Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the
closing of quotation marks when you open them. 

2.) syntax highlighting: 

Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read. 

3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue): 

These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes.

4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them: 

As you become more familiar with coding, you may want to add more features to your text editor. You’ll want to accomplish more with minimal effort. You want a text editor that can grow with you as your needs grow. This comes in the form of extensions. Extensions are like plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that
you wouldn’t have otherwise. 

#### Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer: 

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”. 

Since these text editors already come on your computers, why should you download yet another text editor that does essentially the same thing as the text editor that you already have? There are other text
editors that have features that you may be interested in, Usually the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.

- If you want to try using the text editors that come with your computer, there’s a couple of caveats that you should be aware of: 

1- make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on
your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. You should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic. 

2- make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere to store your entire website.
As you create new documents with the text editor that comes on your computer, save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders within the main website folder. 

3- make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they
have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. 

#### Using Third-Party Options:

6- Sublime Text: 

Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. It has syntax highlighting, it has code completion, it has themes and extensions. 

#### The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs: 

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. 

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. 


## The Command Line!

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. 

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. 

 When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
